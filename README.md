# affine-cyphers
Here is a code which represents the affine ciphers which is used here to encode and decode the text, yet another way to use cryptography to hide a secret.
Affine cipher is a advanced version of the shift cipher as here we also include multiplication in the cipher to encrypt but again as the keyspace is very small it can be easily 
cracked using brute force. \
Here is a simple representation of this concept.
